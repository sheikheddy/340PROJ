CMP 340 Database Systems Group Project
======================================

This is a mini-project where we find the connected components of a graph using python. It currently uses the networkx library, but we plan to remove this dependency and change to explicit DFS and BFS soon. It is based off of [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26317775/print-connected-components-of-a-graph-in-python). 

## Authors

If you'd like to modify the graph, edit tempset3.txt (each entry is in the format source, dest, weight)
