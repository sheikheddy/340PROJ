CMP 340 Database Systems Group Project
======================================

This is a mini-project where we find the connected components of a graph using python.

The DFS implementations is from [this website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/). We assume an undirected unweighted graph with an adjacency list representation. The BFS implementation is based on pseudocode from [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) 

## TODO

 - Insert counters
 - Analyze efficiency of algorithms
 - Write report
