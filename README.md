CMP 340 Database Systems Group Project
======================================

This is a mini-project where we find the connected components of a graph using python.

The DFS implementations is from [this website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/). We assume an undirected unweighted graph with an adjacency list representation. The BFS implementation is based on pseudocode from [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) 

## TODO

 - Add graph generator
 - Insert counters
 - Analyze efficiency of algorithms

## Authors

Sheikh Abdur Raheem Ali

## Usage

Just run `python3 graph.py` to start the program. Alternatively, use your favorite IDE.

If you'd like to modify the graph, edit tempset3.txt (each entry is in the format source, dest, weight)
